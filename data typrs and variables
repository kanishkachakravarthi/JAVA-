java data types and variables

Java is statically typed and also a strongly typed language because, in Java, 
each type of data (such as integer, character, hexadecimal, packed decimal, and so forth) is predefined as part of the programming language and all constants 
or variables defined for a given program must be described with one of the Java data types.

Data types in Java are of different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable 
that is made as per convenience and circumstances to cover up all test cases. Java has two categories in which data types are segregated

Primitive Data Type: boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float,
Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type: such as String, Array,

Primitive Data Type: such as boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float, and double. 
The Boolean with uppercase B is a wrapper class for the primitive data type boolean in Java.
Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type: such as String, Array, etc.

Primitive Data Type: boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float,
Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type: such as String, Array,

Primitive Data Type: 
boolean > True/False 
char   > "a"
int    > 1,2,3,4,
float  > 2.0, 10.9, 3.0

Variables:memory location Data type how needs allocate Java variable 
datatypes together Primitive value time Reference values that
